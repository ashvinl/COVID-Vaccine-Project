Yes, we will demand that the 1% pays its fair share and we will use that revenue to invest in working families.\n",

It’s time we listen to scientists, not the fossil fuel industry.\n",

Not to pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, which has unprecedented spending to cut carbon emissions, would be grossly irresponsible. We must pass this bill and save the planet.\n",
